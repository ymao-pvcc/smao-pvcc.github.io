 <h3>Briefly describe how a text file can be hidden in a steganogrpahic image:</h3>
 <p>A text file can be hidden in an image file by changing the least significant
  bit of each byte of the image file to match the binary form of the characters
  in the text</p>

<h2>Brackets</h2>
<h3>Questions</h3>
 <ol>
    <li>What is Brackets? It is a text-editor that is designed to help coders format their websites easily. </li>
    <li>How much does it cost? 0 dollars; it's free</li>
    <li>Describe several extensions you can download to enhance Brackets: Beautify - makes your code look good;Autoprefixer ToDo- display all the to-do comments; Autoprefixer- goes through your code and add prefixes to your styles</li>
 </ol>
 <h3>Crypt Games</h3>
 <ol>
    <li>Easy ciphers game: It was easy. Kind of reminds me of the internet IQ tests. You don't really have to read the instruction. There's one step to decode </li>
    <li>Normal ciphers game: It was still pretty easy. I started with column then row at first so it was not making any words. There's two steps to decode </li>
    <li>Hard ciphers game: It took a little longer to decrypt. There's one step to decode </li>
 </ol>

  <h2>My Opinion:</h2>
  <p>1.What do you think of Christine McCarthy and her cipher games project? </p>
  <ul><li> I thought it was very cool, fun, and engaging. She is very talented and the website was very organized. </li></ul>
  <p>2.	Would you recommend this site to others who might be interested in cryptography?</p>
  <ul><li>I think it is definitely a website I'd recommend. It's fun because it has games and it helps you learn the names for cryptography</li></ul>
  <p>3.	What do you think of Christine’s code?</p>
  <ul><li>When I was looking at page source, We have pretty much learned all these codes in this semester. I think she was able to make it more neat. </li></ul>
