<h2>Chapter 9: Introduction to High Level Languages</h2>
<h3>List for disadvantages of using assembly language:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The programmer must “manually” manage the movement of data
            items between and among memory locations and registers</li>
        <li>The programmer must take a microscopic view of a task, breaking it
            down into tiny subtasks.</li>
        <li>Machine-specific</li>
        <li>Statements are not natural-language-like.</li>
    </ol>

<h3>List four expectations programmer have for writing programs in a high_level alnguage ("third generation" language): </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The programmer need not manage the details of the movement of
            data items within memory or pay any attention to exactly where those
            items are stored.</li>
        <li>The programmer can take a macroscopic view of tasks, thinking at a
            higher level of problem solving. </li>
        <li>Programs are portable rather than machine specific.</li>
        <li>Programming statements are closer to natural language and use standard
            mathematical notation.</li>
    </ol>

 <h2>Chapter 10: Tower of Babel: Programming Languages </h2>

 <h3>Questions & Answers:</h3>
 <p><i>Q: Why does the textbook refer to "the Tower of Babel" regarding computer languages?</i></p>
 <p>A: Because it seems easier if every program is written in one language</p>
 <p><i>Q: Why isn't there just one computer programming language?</i></p>
 <p>A: Because each language was designed to meet the specific needs of one particular area of application </p>
 <p><i>Q: Why didn't FORTRAN use the less than ( < ) symbol when comparing two numbers?</i></p>
 <p>A:the keypunches that were used to create the punched cards on which early Fortran programs were submitted to the computer had no < symbols </p>
 <p><i>Q: What was COBOL designed for ?</i></p>
 <p>A: serve business needs such as managing inventories and payrolls</p>
 <p><i>Q: What was the langauge, C , designed for? </i></p>
 <p>A: systems programming, in particular for writing operating system</p>
 <p><i>Q: What is the difference between C and C++?</i></p>
 <p>A: C++ is a “superset” of C; all of the C language is part of C11.</p>
 <p><i>Q: Who or what is the language, Ada, named for and why?</i></p>
 <p>A: Ada Augusta Byron Lovelace, daughter of the poet Lord Byron and later the wife of Lord Lovelace. She is regarded as the world’s first programmer</p>
 <p><i>Q: What is a Java "applet"?</i></p>
 <p>A: (small applications) programs designed to run from webpages</p>
 <p><i>Q: How much does Python cost to download, install, and use?</i></p>
 <p>A: It is free</p>
 <p><i>Q: What is Microsoft. NET?</i></p>
 <p>A: a giant collection of tools for software development</p>

 <p>A: It is a programming language used to sort data </p>
 <p><i>Q: What is R and waht is it used for ?</i></p>
 <p>A: specialized programming language designed for statistical computing
    and graphics.</p>
 <p><i>Q: What is Go (or golang) and what is it used for?</i></p>
 <p>A: a programming language developed at Google</p>
 <p><i>Q: What is Swift and what is it used for?</i></p>
