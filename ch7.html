 <h3>Briefly describe the five layers of TCP/IIP</h3>
 <ol>
    <li>Layer 1. Physical Layer: govern the exchange of binary digits (bits</li>
    <li>Layer 2. Data link layer: regulates two machines connected by a communication link.</li>
    <li>Layer 3. Network layer: Create a universal addressing scheme for all network nodes and Delivering messages between any two nodes.</li>
    <li>Layer 4. Transport layer:create a “program-to-program” delivery service that delivers data .</li>
    <li>Layer 5. Application layer: implementing the end-user services provided by a network</li>
 </ol>
 <h3>List and briefly describe at least 3 network services and benefits </h3>
 <ol>
    <li>Interpersonal Communications</li>
    <li>Social Networking: ability to talk to others without seeing them in person</li>
    <li>Resource Sharing: ability to share physical resources</li>
 </ol>
