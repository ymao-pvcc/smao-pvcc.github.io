<h2>Chapter 12: Models of Computation</h2>
<h3>1. What is the purpose of Model?</h3>
<p>They are created to solve problems systematically, so it is more effiecent. </p>

<h3>2. List four phenomena of a model:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>a.Captures the important things </li>
        <li>b.Probably differs in scale from the real thing </li>
        <li>c.Omits some of the details of the real thing;</li>
        <li>d.Lacks the full functionality of the real thing.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>3. List four things a computing agent should be able to do : </h3> 
    <ul>
        <li>a. Accept input</li>
        <li>b. Store information in memory and retrieve it from memory.</li>
        <li>c.Take actions according to algorithm instructions; the choice of what action
            to take may depend on the present state of the computing agent, as
            well as on the input item presently being processed</li>
        <li>d. Produce output</li>
    </ul>
<h3>4. List four characteristics of an algorithm: </h3> 
    <ul>
        <li>a.well-ordered collection </li>
        <li>b.consist of unambiguous and effectively computable operations</li>
        <li>c.halt in a finite amount of time</li>
        <li>d. produce a result</li>
    </ul>
