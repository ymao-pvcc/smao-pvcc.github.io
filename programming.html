<h1>Chapter 5: Programming Algorithms & Software Testing</h1>

<h2>Phases of computer program developments:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Phase 1: Understand the problem</li>
        <li>Phase 2: Design an algorithm to solve the problem</li>
        <li>Phase 3: Write the program code in appropriate language based on the algorithm</li>
        <li>Phase 4: Enter the prgram and save</li>
        <li>Phase 5: Execute the program</li>
        <li>Phase 6: Test the program, find errors and debug, then retest</li>
        <li>Phase 7: Document and evaluate the program</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Programming structures:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sequential structure: Top-down execution</li>
        <li>Decision structures: if/then/else</li>
        <li>Iterative(looping):
            <ul>
                <li>while loop: continue looping as long something is true</li>
                <li>repeat/until loop: continue looping until something is true</li>
                <li>for loop: loop a given number of times</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Recursive structure:
            <ul>
                <li>Repeat a set of instructions as a subtask of itself</li>
                <li>Repetition continues until:
                    <ul>
                        <li>degenerative case, which is a termination condiion, is met.</li>
                        <li>(degenerative case is also called a "base case"</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
<h2>Two classic programming/database problems</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sorting: Descending order/Ascending order</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Sorting numbers </li>
                <li>Sorting strings (in accordance with ASCII values</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Searching: find specific data that meet a certain criteria</li>
            <ul>
                <li>In database:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Filters: temporary search</li>
                        <li>Queries: search criteria are saved so they don't have to be recreated.</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>
        <li>Two popular search techniques:
            <ul>
                <li>Sequential search: search form top to bottom or bottom to top, one item at a time</li>
                <li>Binary search:
                    <ul>
                        <li>only works if data is SORTED first</li>
                        <li>start in the middle, then go to half of that, etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
<h2>Two classic program goals:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Efficiency: Program takes minimal time and/or resources</li>
        <li>CorrectnessL Program runs in expected ways and works for all expected conditions</li>
    </ul>

            Project teams test each build as it becomes available. This type of software testing relies on test automation that is integrated with the deployment process. It enables software to be validated in realistic test environments earlier in the process â€“ improving design and reducing risks.
